## --------- Getting Started with Create React App -----------

1. Install Node.js and npm: React requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your system. Refer this link for installation based on your respective device. https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-react/

2. After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js and npm are installed by opening a command prompt and running the following commands: `node -v npm -v` . These commands should display the version numbers for Node.js and npm, respectively.

3. Install Create React App:  On the terminal run the command `npm install -g create-react-app` . This command installs Create React App on your system, making it available to use in any directory.

4. Create a New React App: Once create-react-app is installed, you can create a new React app by running the following command: `npx create-react-app my-app` . Replace 'my-app' with the name you want to give to your React app.

5. Navigate to the project directory: After creating the React app, navigate to the directory of your newly created app. In the command prompt, run the following command `cd my-app` . Replace “my-app” with the name of your project directory.

6. Start the Development Server: Once inside your React app directory, you can start the development server by running: `npm start` . 

7. A new browser window should open with your React application running at http://localhost:3000/  . 'npm start' command launches the development server, which watches for changes to your project files and automatically reloads the browser when changes are detected.
